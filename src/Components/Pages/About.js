            I graduated with a Bachelor's of Science in Computer Engineering from UCF 
            and am currently working on my Associate's in Computer Information Technology 
            from Valencia. I had three years experience with the Java language and C Language. 
            I've worked with development boards for two years and that is where I started 
            getting experience with assembly language. The most exciting thing that I've 
            done with hardware was programming touch user interface for a Senior design 
            project and integrating the touch screen with the main controller as well as 
            integrating the code that controls the motors and servos that run the machine 
            with the main controller and the touch controller. As of now while I'm looking 
            for a job I'm just teaching myself various things like scripting languages like 
            python, javascript, SQL, etc. and review the languages I know to keep myself fresh 
            and busy. Along with that, I'm currently prototyping a game engine as a hobby and 
            for future use. My hope is to get an entry level job that involves software 
            development in order to build or create something that people can use.
